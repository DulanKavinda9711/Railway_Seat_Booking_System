# Railway Seat Booking and Schedule Management System
The Sri Lankan Railway Department is poised to revolutionize its ticket booking process by adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), aimed at enhancing accessibility and scalability. This innovative solution modularizes functionalities into independent services, ensuring seamless interaction between components and promoting ease of maintenance and future expansion. Passengers can conveniently search for trains, select seats, and book tickets through a user-friendly web-based client application. Moreover, the system extends its services to external partners like travel agents via an API, fostering integration with existing systems.
